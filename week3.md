What's New?

This week we learned how to use Figma. We were each tasked to recreate and add our own twist to a different social media platform.
The platform that I chose was Netflix. I was able to succesfully recreate the Netflix app for an iphone, making changes to some of 
the fonts, font sizes, icons and colors to make the app more consistent and more user friendly. 

Adjustments

In week two I faced some challenges with creating my chatbot in tock.ai. This week I worked on reading the documentation to try to get a
clearer picture of how the framework itself works. However I still ran into some roadblocks becasue the documentation was not as 
informative as it could have been. It tended to tell you how to do something but not what it was? and why?. It had major holes in the 
information it was trying to convey. So I had to change approaches and looked to just using the framework and trying different things to 
see what it does and how it works to better understand how to use it.

In week 2 I also found sources for my literature review. However, at the end of that week after reading the articles I found that the 
articles I choose were either not as in depth in terms of providing the inforamtion I needed as pertains to Trustworthy AI or had no 
real significance as pertains to our project. Therefore, this week I looked into finding new articles. I found three articles that I 
think embodies the research that we are doing. We were also tasked with creating a presentation to convey the information disseminated 
in the articles which I was able to succesfully complete by Friday.

In all this week had it's challenges but with quick readjustments I was able to complete the tasks for the week. And I look forward to 
learning new things and being challenged in the next upcoming week.
