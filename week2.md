The assignment this week was to find two low code frameworks and create chatbots that answered questions on Trustworthy AI. The two 
frameworks that I chose were at first were ChatterBot and Wit.ai after realizing that the framework was beyond my abilities as it 
required coding. Then on Tuesday afternoon, I switched with my group member to Botpress and Tock.ai.

 Botpress was the easier of the two frameworks to use. It came with its own custom template that taught you step by step how to use the 
 AI. It used visual, audio and tactile aids which made learning how to do things easy. However, where it failed was teaching you why?
 After show and tell I realized that even though I knew how to use it, I didn't comprehend why needed to do what we did and what they 
 actually meant.
 
Tock.ai was more difficult to use. Especially getting a late start, I skipped some steps in the process including the documentation. 
And instead opted to try to use youtube videos which were hard to find, because I was more focused on the outcome than actually learning 
the information. I was able to learn how to use by using the youtube video on tock.ai's website and messing around with the software.
I was able to complete my chat bot and train it to answer certain questions pertaining to trustworthy AI based on a list of questions 
that my fellow group members and I compiled. 

Show and tell taught me a lot about what i was doing wrong and what I need to do better. One of which is I need to stop making 
assumptions and I need to be more vocal with my concerns and questions. In all, the challenges I faced this week have taught me a lot
that I'll be able to draw from later on in life.
