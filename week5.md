This week we were tasked with updating our figma mockup and updating our curriculums. However, my tasks looked a bit different for the week, since last week it was decided that my framework would be changed to Botpress. I spent Monday-Wednesday reading through as much of the documentation as I could. Unlike Tock.ai whose documentation was not as extensive Botpress' documentation is extremely extensive. I still wasn't able to fully get through most of it because it was only 3 days, but I was able to gather enough to understand the basics of the framework to create a basic chatbot. I  was able to create the beginning of my curriculum Powerpoint, which includes information about (how to create a botpress account, how to create a bot, how to use Botpress Studio, creating nodes, sending messages, creating variables etc.).

I made the corrections to my figma that were suggested during show and tell in the previous week. I also proceeded to add more frames to my app these included a sign up screen, a sign in screen, a menu screen and a splash screen. I also made a demo of my Figma for the mid-summer symposium, showing how the application would work. I also worked on my powerpoint for the weekly video and the powerpoint for the midsummer symposium. This week was a bit more hectic for me, as I had a lot to do, but I was able to complete my tasks.
