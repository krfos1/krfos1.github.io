This week was the week of the mid-summer symposium. As participants we were tasked with creating powerpoints that would give insight into what we accomplished within the first 5 weeks of the Summer AI Research Intitute. As a group we created our powerpoint using the template provided to us by Dr. Mack. I was also tasked with creating a demo of my figma with a voice over. On Monday I worked on this demo to add to our presentation, we also practiced our presentation with our mentors and Dr. Mack to ensure that everything was up to standard so that on the day of presentation(Wednesday) we would be prepared.
