This week was the week of the mid-summer symposium. As participants we were tasked with creating powerpoints that would give insight into what we accomplished within the first 5 weeks of the Summer AI Research Intitute. As a group we created our powerpoint using the template provided to us by Dr. Mack. I was also tasked with creating a demo of my figma with a voice over.
