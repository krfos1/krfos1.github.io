What's New

This week I created a mockup for the chatbot I created using Botpress in Figma. I created a curriculum for Tock.ai this week as well but after discussion with Dr. Mack and we decided that Tock.ai was not the best framework to use for this project. We went to NASA this week which was very interesting, I learned a lot. The trip reminded me of why I wanted to be in STEM in the first place.

Adjustments

This week was a shorter week, we only had 3 days in our research lab. This was due to the NASA trip and the Juneteenth holiday. Creating the Figma mockup took up alot of time, Figma can be very time consuming because of the amount of details that go into creating each frame. You have to ensure that everything on the screen is technically clickable. This week I was able to create 6 frames( a home screen, three chat screens, a favorites screen, a history screen, and a profile screen). I spent a lot of time creating the tock curriculum, I spent the weeks before reading documentation, searching the internet for videos which all held some information, but it was harder to decipher because alot of it required a more intermediate coding background to decipher. I was able to create the curicullum but it got scrapped at the end of the week. For next week I will be switching to Botpress and I will be tasked to create a new curriculum for that framework.
