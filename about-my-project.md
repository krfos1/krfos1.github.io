## About My Project

Trustworthy AI

Problem: Chatbots can be used by educators to assist in the the classroom however, how can they know that the AI's responses will be trustworthy?


Approach: During this project, I will design a chatbot using a low code framework. I will accomplish the following: 

- answer questions about Trustworthy AI using chatbots.

- show steps on how to build a chatbot using different frameworks.

-show which chatbot is most "trustworthy"


Expected Outcome: The project is expected to highlight, what makes AI trustworthy and why it can be trusted. Formulate a curriculum to help educator build and  train chatbots of their own based on which chatbot is deemed "more trustworthy".
