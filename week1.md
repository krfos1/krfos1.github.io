a better understanding of what Dr. Mack will be looking for and what is expected from me as a participant. 

This week has been very informative I learned alot from the workshops and classes. I learned that we can use AI research to 
create solutions to problems that we don't have the answer to yet or to find better ways to improve upon what we already know. 
In Python 101 I learned the fundamentals of python icluding, how to think like a programmer?, what is necessary to make a good

certain things a certain way from a coding standpoint, I was able to get a good grasp on the theory of what machine learning and
its processes are. We also learned about
