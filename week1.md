During the first week, I met with Dr. Naja Mack and my mentor Micheal. We did introductions as a group and I was ale to meet 
the other members in my group. The team building activities allowed me to get to know them better and I look forward to working
with them. Dr. Mack gave us an overview of what the project I will be working on entailed and I gained
a better understanding of what Dr. Mack will be looking for and what is expected from me as a participant. 

This week has been very informative I learned alot from the workshops and classes. I learned that we can use AI research to 
create solutions to problems that we don't have the answer to yet or to find better ways to improve upon what we already know. 
In Python 101 I learned the fundamentals of python icluding, how to think like a programmer?, what is necessary to make a good 
program?, what are variables? etc. And by the end I was able to make my own pseudocodes and code simple python problems.

I learned about Ethics in research and how to conduct responsible research as a participant in the Summer AI Research Institute
this summer. The crash course in machine learning was very informative and although I still have some questions about why we do
certain things a certain way from a coding standpoint, I was still from a theory standpoint able to get a good grasp on the topic 
such as what machine learning is? what are the processes of maching learning?,what is model optimization?, what is supervised learning
and unsupervised learning? We also learned about a bit about creating data frames and numpy. I learned that Git is an open 
source distrubutive version control system. I learned about what is version control and about merge conflicts.

In all this week was I had a lot of new information thrown my way and in the beginning I was feeling a bit overwhelmed. However, now
at the end looking back I was able to retain a lot more than I iniatially though I would.
